Very lucky to have to been part of another great weekend at fforest farm. I only took pictures on the night of the main meal. But the whole weekend was amazing, Pam Yung of Flor/ASAP pizza did some incredible pizzas earlier on the Saturday and Gryff Rhys did a little acoustic set. The menu featured a lot of very local produce, that Brat/Mountain use on their menu in London too. Saturday was probably a little too fun, stayed up until 5am with the staff and Tucker-Lynch brothers and walked home in the pitch black through the wildlife park and got home at basically sunrise.
