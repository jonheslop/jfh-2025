The annual company retreat was near Hereford, only 100 miles from Cardigan and given a couple of weeks earlier Iâ€™d ridden from London to Cardigan with friends, I was feeling fit enough to take on the trip.

I left at 6am and rode over the Cambrian mountains, I think I saw two cars over 5 hours riding, it was beautiful.

These were [my routes](https://www.komoot.com/collection/3609935/-crezco-offsite-2025).
