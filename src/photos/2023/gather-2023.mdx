Every summer we head over to Fforest for Gather and help out with the workshops and see a lot of familiar faces.

This year we went for two weeks, the first was Gather, the second we stayed on and worked remotely from the farm, it was great I think weâ€™ll definitely make that a regular thing.

On the last few nights, the moon was just a slither and I managed to get a few nice shots of the Milky Way which was clearly visible from right outside our Crog.
