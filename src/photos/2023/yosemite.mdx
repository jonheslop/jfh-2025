I’ve never been to Disney Land but maybe Yosemite is a little bit like the nature version. That said the density of all the marvels is miraculous. The winter before we arrived had record snowfall, so the waterfalls and rivers were bursting which made for a great spectical. We only spent a day there but it would have been nice to stay longer to do some hikes out of the valley.
