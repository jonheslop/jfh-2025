Ulf’s from a village in Germany, he’d always mentioned that I should visit sometimes. At Easter around
there they always have big fires, where they stack 'old christmas trees' in a huge stack and burn them.
Different villages stack them differently.

It sounded fun! I suggested we ride there. So after a few years of not being organised enough, Ulf planned
it all out.

We left London at 3pm on a Wednesday and arrived at 6pm on the Friday.
