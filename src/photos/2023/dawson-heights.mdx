[Graeme](https://raeburn.works/) lives in the very famous [Kate Macintosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Macintosh) designed Dawson Heights. He did [Open House](https://programme.openhouse.org.uk/) a while back, I went and it was fun. Open House posted on Twitter asking if anyone wanted to volunteer to open their flat again, so I suggested it to Graeme. I felt like I should help, so I spent the day lending a hand. I did a little supercut of all the times the block had been on TV and we played it on repeat in his living room. Maude did a good job on welcome duty.
