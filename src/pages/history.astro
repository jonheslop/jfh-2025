          Lost history... I made my first website in 2001 it was on the free tld
          <em>jonathanheslop.tk</em>, I’m really sad to not have a backup. I had
          a 0.3megapixel digital camera with a 16mb memory card and I used to
          post photos/videos on there. I was called into the headmasters office
          about it. And they blocked it from the school network.
