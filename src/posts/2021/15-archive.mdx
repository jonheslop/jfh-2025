Before I got going on the [redesign](/posts/15-redesign), I went back and dug out my old websites and have made an (incomplete) history of them all.

- [2017] - this one has things in common with this one
- [2012] - this was a good one, I made this when I was freelancing before I moved back to London
- [2011] - I liked this one too, this was a basically a carbon copy of [Naz Hamid’s](https://nazhamid.com/) ‘The personal page‘ idea, it was a great idea.
- [2010] - This one was well ugly
- [2009] - This was the first one I made after getting a job I think

I have had a website as far back as maybe 2001 but I think they might be lost forever, which is a real shame because they would be well funny now.
