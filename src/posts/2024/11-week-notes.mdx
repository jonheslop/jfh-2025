Went to the BFI IMAX on Wednesday with Dov and Jason to see [Dune: Part Two](https://letterboxd.com/jonheslop/film/dune-part-two/). I loved it, it wasn’t perfect but it was still great. The IMAX makes it such an experience too, almost overwhelmingly big, but in a good way.

On the weekend we went to Hay-on-Wye to stay with our friends, and see their new-ish house. It in an amazing spot looking out across the valley/basin they sit in, with the Wye meandering through. The house is on a big plot, so they’ve got so much space, with lots of nice, BIG, trees and various bushes. There was a big magnolia getting with flowers nearly ready to bust open. They even had a big stream coming down the hillside so there was the constant background noise of rushing water. It was brill!

On the Saturday evening we went into town and had dinner and then Richard was playing records at a little pop up event which was a nice way to while away the evening.

[Puzzmo](https://www.puzzmo.com/) is turning me into a crossword person something I’ve never really gotten into before!

Stumbled onto [this studio’s site](https://www.studiofeixen.ch/) and [their nice fonts](https://fonts.studiofeixen.ch/) the other day.
