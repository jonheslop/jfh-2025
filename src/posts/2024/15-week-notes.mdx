- The loft conversion continues apace, I cycle to the house every morning and work from here. I basically do a morning standup with the builders. It’s just like making a website out of wood.
- Except incredibly dusty, we’re keeping all the doors shut but it’s mad how it gets everywhere.
- The upstairs has no ceilings now, but there are two new steel beams spanning the house and new ceiling/floor joists.
- I met my friend Ben, for beers/dinner at _The Plimsoll_ in Finsbury Park on Wednesday, had not been since the Four Legs people reopened the pub. It was great, enjoyed it more than I thought. Would go again.
- Ben lives in Highbury, about a 15mins walk away, but he let me give him a lift home on the cargo bike, was a lot of uphill, but I loved it. My first passenger.
- On Friday afternoon Bec and I drove down to St. Leonards-on-Sea and then a bit later Kate and Lianne got the train joined us.
- It was quite sunny all weekend which made a very nice change, we really enjoyed bobbing about the town, walking on the promenade
- On Saturday morning, Maude stole a half eaten sausage bap off someone on the beach. Mortifying... I apologised and offered to buy them a new one, they were very reasonable about it, could have gone a lot worse.
- I clocked it was about to happen about three seconds before it did, but I was about a second too slow to stop it, once she got it, she absolutely pegged it off to eat it miles away from us. So naughty.
- On Saturday night we ate at Farmyard which was very good.
- On Sunday morning, we ate breakfast at Goat Ledge, which was where Maude had stolen the sandwich the day before, it was very good TBF.
