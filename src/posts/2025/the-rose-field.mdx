description: The final volume of Pullman’s The Book of Dust triology 
---

Read Philip Pullman’s latest book this week, [_The Rose Field_](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/trf-patricia-pushlady/7864565?ean=9780241458693) which is part of _The Book of Dust_ triology. The book takes place 10 years after the events of _His Dark Materials_. I loved the original triology and really enjoyed the new story in the latest books, so was looking forward to it all tying up in this final one.

It’s felt like a long time coming but supposedly COVID and age slowed Pullman down. I really the love the world he’s built and the last two books journeying through the Levant and Caucasus we’re fun. The concept of dæmons is so much fun and I guess it works really well as a literary device. One time whilst I was reading it, Maude was lying up against my leg sleeping and I wondered if I had a dæmon, would it be Maude? I think I’d be happy with that.

It perhaps felt like it all ended a little quick with quite a few dangling storylines that didn’t really resolve and left me wondering. It felt like this was a critique of capitalism (like his earlier triology was a critique of religion).
