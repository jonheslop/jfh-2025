Quiet week followed by fun weekend — Bec’s sister and her girlfriend came to stay and we had a sunshine filled weekend of walks, beaches, pubs and dinners (and hangovers). I particularly enjoyed the [Bocs Du](https://www.instagram.com/bocsdu/) burger I had on Saturday night.

I managed to get out for a short 30km spin on the bike on Sunday morning and it was so nice. Down by Ceibwr, I saw a kestrel hovering before diving. The mornings are light enough now that I need to start getting out for pre-work rides, roll on summer.

I read [this scathing piece by John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/something_is_rotten_in_the_state_of_cupertino) on Apple’s promises of AI vapourware, it fits with what everyone’s doing all over the industry and it’s depressing.

But right after reading I checked the news (and Bluesky) and read about the [Government announcements about cutting civil service staff numbers with AI efficiency drive](https://news.sky.com/story/ai-tech-teams-to-be-sent-into-government-departments-as-part-of-starmers-efficiency-drive-13327407). Not only is it a wind up they’re taking cues from Musk and DOGE but how incredibly baseless it is to imagine replacing people’s jobs with an AI agent.

Here’s a pic of Ffynone waterfall which according to the [Mabinogion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mabinogion) is the gateway to Annwn (which sorta means underworld but literally means _here but deeper_ — which is very cool).
