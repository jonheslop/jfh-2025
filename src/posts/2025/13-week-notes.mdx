description: Being ill, Studio Ghibli and BBQ short rib
---

As mentioned last week I was ill all week. Which makes this edition late and brief. I haven’t had a cold/flu/who knows that bad in a log time if ever, was wiped out all week. It’s so boring being ill.

I did watch one film during my time laying around, _The Boy and Heron_ which I enjoyed. I watched it with subtitles and only when I finished did I realise it had such a glitzy lineup of English dubbers — I had to rewind and hear what Robert Pattinson’s heron sounded like.

It was also well timed because the next day OpenAI dropped their new model and the Ghiblislop (an unfortunate portmanteau that I can’t help but see my own name in) went viral. It’s depressing and cringe. The artwork of the film is so incredible and the imitations are so so poor. I can see why people like it tho, you can get something ok, with zero effort, but it’s sad. This was a good summary of [why it’s terrible](https://tante.cc/2025/03/28/vulgar-display-of-power/).

[Garbage Day’s analysis](https://www.garbageday.email/p/new-elon-musk-crime-dropped#the-speed-of-an-ai-meme), on how AI generated slop has a short shelf life because it has no real value is good too.

By the weekend I was beginning to feel normal again but I took it very easy. The sun shone all weekend which was nice and Bec kept herself busy with her new smoker making some very delicious BBQ short rib which we enjoyed for dinner with friends on both Saturday and Sunday.

The fact it’s light here until ~20:30 now the clocks have changed feels miraculous. I know this happens every year but it never ceases to be amazing.
