description: Tuesdays are the new Sundays
---

Third week in a row I’ve done this on a Tuesday, maybe that should just be when it happens. It’s mainly because the sun’s been shining and we were out enjoying it on Sunday.

Obviously it’s been alarming and worrying with Trump’s tariffs but as someone who likes reading the news it’s been interesting to keep up with it all. Probably not very healthy habit though.

We’re going to America to visit my sister in August and I am increasingly alarmed about what sort of state things will be in when we go (like is it reasonable to worry if I need to purge group chats where Trump has been mentioned?). On the other hand I’m probably over hyping the drama and it will be fine, mainly because I am coddled in privilege.

After a couple of weeks of fighting off a cough, I finally got back on the bike on the weekend and did [a chill 40km ride to Newport and back](https://www.strava.com/activities/14085825611). I didn’t want to over do it, so kept my heart rate down (which is difficult it being so hilly around here). I’ve never tried to do that before and was surprised when Strava said I actually did quite well on the climbs I do a lot. It looks like pacing yourself up a hill actually is good, who would have thought it.

[gif.land](https://home.gif.land/) went down for like 12? days and I didn’t notice! It was because [Turso](https://turso.tech/blog/turso-aws-out-of-beta) did some big migration and I was missed off so the SQLite DB went offline. Serves me right for over-engineering it and not setting up any monitoring. I’m still not going to set up monitoring but I might make it fall over more gracefully.

On Friday night, whilst we were having sunshine pints, a pigeon pooped on my head. Third time in my life that has happened to me.
