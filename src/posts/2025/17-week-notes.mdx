description: Bank holiday, London and death
---

Monday was a bank holiday and we had the best day with friends doing a sorta pub crawl but between each others houses instead. The hosts had to provide a drink, snack and entertain us.

We had a lot of incredible snacks: blinis, tartiflette, Bánh mì, tosadas and more! Entertainment was fun too, a harmonica recital, a boat trip, balloon modelling, the Macarena.

The sun was out and it was great, [I took some photos](/posts/2025/jacob-and-zoe). The occasion was as a goodbye party for our friends that are moving to Australia.

On Wednesday evevning we went to London, was fun to be back in the city. I went to the office on Thursday, was good to see people IRL. Thursday night I had some beers and dinner with [Rory](https://rorymal.com/) and we met more friends Friday night in Tottenham.

The trip was cut short for me as I rushed home Saturday morning to my parent’s house to see my 97yo Grandma who’s taken a sudden turn (after being extremely healthly for her age) to say goodbye. First time I’ve had to do something like that. Was obviously difficult and sad, but I’m glad I went. She’s still with us, but I’m not sure for how much longer. She definitely knew I was there but couldn’t really respond. So it was nice to see her one last time. She’s had a very good innings.
