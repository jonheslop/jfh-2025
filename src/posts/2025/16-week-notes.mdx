Another busy week seeing friends most evenings. 

On Monday Richard was down and we had fish and chips and went for a walk around Moylegrove. We mainly discussed politics and how this gov has been even worse than we even imagined they would be.

On Wednesday we all watched the Real Madrid v. Arsenal match at the pub which was brilliant. Looking forward to getting together again for the semis with PSG.

I enjoyed the first episode of the new _The Last of Us_. Horror isn’t really my bag but I can handle it in this case. I never played the second game but I don’t think that’s important really. 

Friday night we had dinner with James, Siân and Mandy. I played the new _Bon Iver_ album, James said he preferred the sadder sounding stuff. I love it all equally!

Saturday was a day of cooking and prep, as on Monday we’ve doing a sort of pub crawl but not to pubs but to 7 friends houses. Each couple has to provide a drink and snack. We’re doing tostada’s and hibiscus margs. Bec smoked a big bit of chuck and prepared the liquor to cook it in. 
We’re the 5th house. Expect it’s going to get rowdy. 

On Sunday I cycled 80km to St. David’s. Was a beautiful day and a really nice ride. It’s very hilly here but that’s good and the roads are so quiet. When we move back to London I’m really gonna miss the riding. Spring is really starting to pop you can see all the ferns beginning to come out.

Bec drove down to meet me. And we had lunch in and walked around a bit. Including popping into the cathedral which was very impressive. The floor slopes 4m across its length which felt weird/cool. The light was nuts in there there were a lot of atmospheric shafts of light. I couldn’t see any incense or candles and wondered if they blasted a smoke machine before it opened for the vibes.

We went to Whitesands Beach for a run about with Maude. The rock formations around there are nuts and give it a lot of drama. Then we dropped into Porthgain. Bec and I were last there 11 years ago before we even got together. It’s such a great spot the ruins of brickworks right on the harbour is really fun.

Four day weeks rule, imagine if it was always like this.
