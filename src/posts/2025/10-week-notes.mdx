## Some links

Finally got around to reading [Marcin Wichary’s 6000 word piece on Gorton](https://aresluna.org/the-hardest-working-font-in-manhattan/) a really old font designed to be engraved into things using a pantograph machine, I didn’t know about any of this! But my keyboard uses it. Incredibly impressive write up.

I’d read about the [Long Now Foundation](https://longnow.org/) before, but really enjoyed [this piece in Asterisk Mag](https://asteriskmag.com/issues/08/chimes-at-midnight), amazing they actually got a clock built, sad that Jeff Bezos owns it and hardly anyone will ever get to see it.

This [Guardian long read](https://www.theguardian.com/global/ng-interactive/2025/mar/05/zizians-artificial-intelligence) was quite shocking - on a group of AI theorists who basically descended into cult-like madness and killed some people.

# Paternoster Farm

Friday was Bec’s birthday and we drove an hour south to Pembrokeshire and went to dinner at [Paternoster Farm](https://dishcult.com/restaurant/paternosterfarm1). It’s a set menu and there were 5 courses and it was very delicious. Really laid back, it’s so remote but it’s amazing when you do something that well, people will travel for it.

We stayed nearby in Stackpole and the morning after did a nice big 10km walk around Bosherton, Broad Haven and Barafundle, was very beautiful. We also saw two otters.

## Bigger is better

I visited the [Hiut Denim](https://hiutdenim.co.uk/) office last week and they had an Apple Pro Display XDR in the office and wowzer does it look nice. Wouldn’t it be nice to have one! (never gonna happen)

## American (rail)road trip

Bec and I going to America in the summer for 4 weeks, flying out to Los Angeles flight and back home from New Orleans. So need to work out how to get between the two — was thinking about driving it but I’ve been looking into sleeper trains.

My current plan is after spending some time in LA with my sis and her fam, drive to Denver via Utah and the Rockies, then get a sleeper train to Chicago, spend some time there, then another sleeper to Austin for a few nights, then finally a train to New Orleans.

Anyway signing off, cycling over to [fforest farm for a sauna](https://www.coldatnight.co.uk/natural-spa) with friends 👋😶‍🌫️
