The CEO of Vercel has been posting some cringe stuff for a while; cozying up to Trump and most recently a selfie with Netanyahu. I’d been curious about giving [Astro](https://astro.build/) a go for a while and the selfie was the kick I needed.

So I’ve [rebuilt gif.land](https://github.com/jonheslop/2026.gif.land_), it’s now running on Cloudflare workers. It’s mostly static html but a few routes like [random](https://gif.land/random) and [search](https://gif.land/search) run as edge functions.

I have a few domains with Vercel and am in the process of moving them over to Cloudflare. But the next big thing to change is this site. It’s been around since 2021 so it’ll be nice to do a fresh redesign anyway.
