Hello! Iâ€™m back here writing week notes again because I love reading other peoples and I want to get better at it too.

Iâ€™ve been particularly inspired by [Robin Sloanâ€™s recent blogging](https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/) and also [Matt Webbâ€™s post](https://interconnected.org/home/2025/02/19/reflections) about his blog being 25 years old!

## Iâ€™m a zwiftee now

I recently borrowed a friendâ€™s turbo trainer and Iâ€™m six weeks into giving Zwift a go. I wouldnâ€™t call it enjoyable but it doing wonders for my fitness. Soon the mornings will be light (and warm) enough to resume my 6am rides but in the meantime itâ€™s really satisfying to know Iâ€™m getting fitter.

## gif.land

Iâ€™ve still been tinkering a lot with [gif.land](https://gif.land), Iâ€™m finding it really rewarding. Iâ€™ve not used Cloudflareâ€™s APIs much before and itâ€™s all so easy to use and well documented.

Iâ€™ve added [info pages](https://home.gif.land/info/bravery.gif) for each gif â€” I mainly did it just so I could make them go full screen which is silly but fun. I even got to use [CSS blend mode stuff](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mix-blend-mode) which is fun in a _itâ€™s 2004 and Iâ€™ve just discovered photoshop blend modes_.

## Sunshine on a Saturday

We got lucky with some incredible weather - and weâ€™d planned to do a big walk with friends along the Pembrokeshire coastal path which was amazing.
