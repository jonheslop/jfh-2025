This week I’ve just got three wildlife stories.

On Wednesday we went up to fforest farm for a BBQ with friends. We cycled home around 11pm. When we were locking our bikes we could hear splashing in the river. Being in the moonlight it was quite hard to make out but we realised there were at least 3 otters fishing. You could see them coming up and floating along and you could hear them chomping on fish. They even did a few loud high pitched calls to each other from various spots around the river. It was magical! To think that they’re there doing this most nights is mad. We watched them for a good 15 minutes.

Most mornings we walk Maude through the marshes just up the river from us there’s usually ducks and curlew about. We walk as far as the first hide and I sit in there for a few minutes to look out at the river. Two mornings in a row I saw the same Bar-tailed Gotwit. The first day it was very thorough bathing and preening and the next day it was sleep on a perch. They’ve developed a really rich terracotta coloured breast which means they’re ready to breed. A woman came in to watch it too and she looked much more pro than me with all the gear — she said that there had been two wintering here and we just about to leave for the Lapland.

Another evening I was riding through the marshes and a sparrowhawk (I think), swooped out of a bush right in front of my head and then flew along only about 2 meters in front of me just at eye line. It had some scruffy looking bundle in it’s mouth which I presume was another bird! It stayed in front of me for about 5 seconds before darting off. It was fun because I was going fast enough that I was close enough for a really good look.
