# West Wales sauna scene

Monday night was sauna night, since we moved to Wales, we been lucky enough to be saunaing most weeks at our friends place [Sawna Llogsi](https://www.sawnallosgi.co.uk/). Full on scandi lifestyle out here.

## TV

We’ve been enjoying the new series of Severence, I particularly love the colours/design/sets. I’m slightly worried that isn’t going to pay off in terms of piling up more and more unanswered questions. What is the job they do accomplishing? What are the goat people doing? What’s the deal with Patricia Arquette’s character? Where’s his wife gone (think they will answer this one)? I could go on...

Is it a newish trend or has it always happened where cars on TV programmes are much older than anything else on the show? Perhaps Severence is a bad example because they have retro computers etc. I’m not complaining, I like it, aesthetically.

## Timeguessr

Been playing [Timeguessr](https://timeguessr.com/) for a couple of weeks and it really is quite fun. We play it on work calls - sometimes against each other with a 45 second time limit which is hectic in a good way, or together screen sharing all arguing about whether that looks like a 60’s or 70’s car.

## Uploads on gif.land

I’ve added the ability (for just me) to login to the site with Github OAuth and add new GIFs. I’ve used React <code>useActionState</code> for [the form submission](https://github.com/jonheslop/gif.land/blob/main/components/upload-form.tsx) and [server side actions](https://github.com/jonheslop/gif.land/blob/main/app/actions.ts) to handle the [SQLite](https://turso.tech/) and [D2 object storage](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/developer-platform/products/r2/) stuff, it’s all quite neat. It’s definitely decreased the friction for [adding](https://home.gif.land/info/helpcomputer.gif) [new](https://home.gif.land/info/facepalm-haaland.jpg) [things](https://home.gif.land/info/alan-shrug.gif).

# Eager beaver

I loved [this Guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/28/ultimate-bringers-of-life-cornwall-farmer-beavers-stop-flooding
) about a cattle farmer and his beavers, it really is quite remarkable how much good two rodents can do, I am beaver-pilled!

# Spring tide

This Friday bought a particularly large spring tide, along with the higher tides are very low ones, so in the afternoon Bec and a bunch of friends went foraging for mussels.

Then in the evening about 20 of us got together in Llangrannog to eat them, classic _moules marinière avec frites_ but it was incredible. They were so tasty, so much bigger than any I’ve ever had at a restaurant. It was a really fun night.

Sunday we went down to Saundersfoot and used the low tide to forage for razor clams and cockles. The sand looks so barren but it’s amazing how teeming with life it is, the clams and cockles are everywhere. There were also loads of cute hermit crabs.

I’ve never done it before but Siân and Bec showed me how, we had plastic bottles with sea water in that we added a load more salt to, then walk backwards taking small tappy steps to disturb the sand. Eventually an “event/distubance” will happen and you you squirt the salty water down the hole, after a while the clam will appear and you grab it by it’s shell, and hold it then pull slowly until you get it out. It’s impressive how strong they are.

Some people were collecting industrial quantities, do they sell them to restuarants? Can you do that? Looking forward to eating ours later.
