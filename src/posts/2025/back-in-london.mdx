description: Reflecting on our time away and how it feels to be back in London

Eighteen months ago Bec and I moved to Cardigan. Bec took a sabatical and I am lucky enough to be able to work fully remote. We planned on only staying twelve months but extended it to fit in a second summer.

Being back in our home is good, I’m enjoying the space (our rented flat in Wales was much smaller). Coming back to a bunch of stuff we’d packed away meant reckoning with it all, which resulted in a lot of charity shop runs, selling stuff on ebay and leaving random things outside our house for people to away (surprisingly quickly).

I haven’t left Walthamstow as much as I’d have thought I would. I haven’t exactly dived back in to metropolitan life, mainly just our daily walks to Lloyd Park with Maude. Which feels very different to the rich social life we had in Wales, we had a lot of friends close by and being a small town — a group message could go out at 16:45 and we’d all be in the pub 15mins later. Which was incredible and I loved it. Having a local pub where you feel relaxed really is very nice. I miss [The Castle](https://www.castle.pub/), the pints and the company dearly.

However I’ve been enjoying the quieter evenings at home with Bec. I think that’s partly the time of year (dark and cold by 5pm) and the fact we’ve been more making the most of having our big kitchen back and being more adventurous with our cooking.

Decluttering the house, getting DIY done and planning to get the loft conversion fully finished is keeping our minds and bodies busy. Once the loft is complete, we’ll have the house as close to the asymptotic ‘finished’ state as possible.

We’re off to Cardigan tomorrow, there’s the [Winter Feast](https://www.coldatnight.co.uk/winter-feast) this weekend. Very much looking forward to being back at the farm hanging out with friends and eating great food. We’re then going to work remotely for the week which will be nice to give us time to catch up with everyone. We hope to go back fairly regularly from now on. We’re very lucky to have friends with [lots](https://www.coldatnight.co.uk/ty-fforest) of [places](https://www.albionaberteifi.co.uk/) to put us up in.

It [snowed massively in West Wales](https://www.bbc.co.uk/cymrufyw/erthyglau/cpv1vlx4g7no) yesterday so maybe we’ll get to enjoy a bit of that too.
