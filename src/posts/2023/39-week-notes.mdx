- The NHS are contacting _everyone_ to get as many people to sign up for [this research thing](https://ourfuturehealth.org.uk/), I went and gave a blood sample on Monday, in Leyton, in an Asda carpark. They told me my cholesterol levels too which I’d never known before.
- I hope in a couple of years there isn’t some long read about how this was a big data giveaway to private companies to do bad things.
- Maude got spayed on Tuesday and was feeling very sorry for herself for a few days... she’s meant to rest for 2 weeks but by Friday she seems fully back to normal (with a quite gnarly scar), we’re still keeping her from running mad in the park chasing balls and stuff.
- Saw [The National](https://www.americanmary.com/) at Ally Pally on Wednesday, with Bec, Jim and Jess. They were good, played for 2.5 hours. Last time I went to a gig there (Arcade Fire, 16 years ago) it sounded so bad that I was put off going back all this time.
- We finished the second series of _The Bear_ this week, really enjoyed it. Particulary liked the Copenhagen and Richie goes to fancy restaurant one. It’s very stressful though.
- Spent a bit time down the allotment on Saturday sorting out the tomatoes in the greenhouse, it‘s amazing how they just grow and grow.
- Saw [Slaughter Beach, Dog](https://cryinglaughingwavingsmiling.com/) on Saturday at the Electric Brixton with Jim and Jess again and Billy and Alice. There were a lot of very young people! It was fun though. Most remarkable thing was the bassist was wearing crocs.
- Today Maude and I went to dog training in Finsbury Park, it’s very full on and a bit stressful but it’s definately good for both of us.
- Then we met Bec, Cass, Ulf and the kids in Lloyd Park for an Octoberfest thing, was fun. I queued 50mins for a beer whilst a lady was yodelling 😵‍💫
- The virginia creeper in the garden is starting to turn red and it’s very exciting.
