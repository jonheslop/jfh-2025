- I met a friend I hadn’t seen since pre-pandemic on Wednesday for dinner. It was really nice to catch up. It’s crazy that it had been so long. Was great to catch up.
- We ate at [BAO](https://baolondon.com/), I also hadn’t been these since 2019, it’s still very delicious.
- [Craig Mod](https://craigmod.com/) did another [pop-up newsletter](https://craigmod.com/newsletters/) which finished at the beginning of the week, I enjoy his writing and photographs so much. I’d love to visit Japan one day but I almost don’t want to ruin the imagined Japan I have from reading his blogs for 10+ years.
- I’ve stayed quite skeptical of AI, I’ve used ChatGPT to help with a few things but not really embraced it (probably to my detriment). I don’t really enjoy the image generators. BUT I did really enjoy [this piece in the New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/20/a-coder-considers-the-waning-days-of-the-craft) where someone wrestles and then gets into using AI tools to help with code.
- Talking of newsletters - Elliot Jay Stocks does a good one, [the latest issue](https://buttondown.email/elliotjaystocks/archive/savour-the-process/) has some great links. I always a sucker for a process post about a typeface, this one about [Name Sans](https://www.arrowtype.com/articles/name-sans-process) was great.
- Which I can’t link to without mentioning Söhne, which this site is currently set in, [the process post for that](https://klim.co.nz/blog/soehne-design-information/) is definitely in GOAT territory.
- Also in Elliot’s email was this [WIP font](https://www.futurefonts.xyz/anna-khorash/invert) which is pretty amazing, the animated GIFs are mesmerising.
- We finished watching season two of _The Wire_, the conceit that got ‘the detail’ back together was brilliant (a dispute between two men trying to donate a stained glass window to a chuch). It was perhaps slower than the first season and maybe a little rushed towards the end. But I still really enjoyed it. Frank Sobotka was a brilliant character. All the stuff around the economics of the docks and longshoremen reminded me of Alexis Madrigal’s excellent [Containers podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/containers/id1209559177). Makes me want to revisit it.
- On the weekend we got the box more finished. We rubbed it all with linseed oil and put some plants in. It’s looking great.

- Off to Fforest next weekend for the Winter feast, I cannot wait!
