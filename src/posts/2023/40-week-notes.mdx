- A quiet start to the week not much went on just the usual routine of WFH, walks with Maude and nights in. We’ve been trying to increase the amount and variety of veg we’re eating. It’s fun pushing ourselves to try new recipes and stuff. We’re also eating a lot less meat without even really noticing/missing it.
- We’ve started watching the third season of _Only Murders in the Building_, it’s still fun although not sure I’m as into the plot this time around.
- Maude seems back to normal after her op last week, scar still looks quite gnarly but she bounding around like it’s no big deal.
- On Thursday, we (Maude and I) went into the office in Notting Hill. We get off the tube at Marble Arch and walk all the way through Hyde Park, which is a really nice way to start the day.
- After work we go down to Victoria to meet Bec near the John Lewis offices and then head down to St. Leonards-on-Sea for a long weekend.
- We stayed in a flat right on the sea front. St. Leonards was really great, lots of good places to eat and drink. I enjoyed all the seafood. Did a couple of chill morning runs on the promenade.
- On the way home we detoured to go to Dungeness, it was super sunny and hot, so not quite what I imagined when you hear about it but it was fun all the same, would definitely like to go back and explore it more.
- I took a lot of photos this weekend as I borrowed a lens from the Fuji store in Thursday, they loan them out for two days for free which seems like good marketing. I borrowed an XF56mm f1.2 R WR badboy, it costs a grand. It was fun although it’s pretty big and heavy. I liked the zoominess though, but maybe would go fo the XF50mm f2 one as it’s a lot more compact.
