- Site can now handle routes like <code>/2023/43-week-notes</code> was actually [a really small change](https://github.com/jonheslop/jfh-2021/commit/cb6d5628650be76c86a65eb96c70557a847351f1#diff-3089dc904201e8646d7307ddcf21738a00fcfd4f7d64662fd1e2de9213e76461). So great how simple Next.js makes things like this.
- Went to the Evian Christ album launch on Thursday with [Rory](https://rorymal.com/), was properly good, really enjoyed it. The stage had a strip of lenses, with fancy lights behind them and so the light was sort of separated like a prism and it looked sick.

- On Saturday night we finally got down to Homies on Donkeys, hadn’t been since it moved to Leyton, properly good tacos.
- Also this weekend we made a lot of progress with the bike box, Bec spent both days burning the battens, she’s done all 300m now. - I managed to finish cladding the boxes. Had to hand the doors which was tricky, so many planes/angles to get it right, to get a nice swing.
- Not looking forward to putting the locks in.
