- Second week back at it and already a day late.
- My excuse is I spent a lot of time this weekend rebuilding this whole site which detracted from writing the notes
- The site runs on Next.js v12, the current version, v13, is quite a big change and it wasn’t a simple upgrade, it’s now working locally but something about [ContentLayer](https://contentlayer.dev/), webpack and Next.js aren’t playing ball when running the build on Vercel.
- Our allotment continues to pay dividends (mostly thanks to Bec being good at thinking ahead) but we still have so many tomatoes, raspberries carrots and potatoes.
- We pulled up some potatoes on Saturday and was a real bumper crop, much bigger than the other varieties we’d already pulled. Potatoes are particularly satisfying as it’s all a surprise what’s gonna come.
- Maude got hand stripped on Monday (for the first time), which means she had a hair cut, but they do it different for border terriers, she looks very different (to us), I sorta think she looked better all shaggy but it’s also funny how smooth she feels and lean she looks now. I’m sure it will grow back in no time.
- We’re going through a growth spurt at work, lots of hiring going on and there’s been some spreading out of responsibilities around the team, which is fun/different/tumultuous. I’ve been running retros, I’m having to learn to not talk through all the silence, and give other time to think/speak.
- The dev team are all spread out around the UK/IE and some of us haven’t met face-to-face yet, so I’ve volunteered to organise some sort of get together, so we can all talk strategy and stuff for next year.
