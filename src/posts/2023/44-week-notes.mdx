- This week after years of saying we’d get around to it, started watching _The Wire_, we’ve blitzed through ten episodes already and we’re enjoying it. Just like everone says Michael K Williams’ Omar Little performance is brill.
- I gave blood on Tuesday, my 32nd time. I do it at the Stratford Donor Centre, inside the Westfield, it’s basically the only time I go there. Mad place.
- I fitted to locks on the bike box over the weekend, it’s so fiddly but satisfying in the end. Did two on each door for max security.
- Also bolted the whole thing down to the concrete it sits on with some very cool concrete anchors. This box aint going nowhere.
- Didn’t go see any fireworks this year. Can still hear them popping off right now.
