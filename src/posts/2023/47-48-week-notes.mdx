- Double notes this week, we were away last Sunday at Fforest and then came home Monday and were struck down with a nasty bug
- We had a brilliant time though, we were there Friday to Monday staying in a Hill Shac with Jess, Jim, Graeme, Colin and Emma. It was the Fforest Winter feast on the Saturday night, really great food and loads of tasty natural wines!

- Maude had the best time running around free for the weekend, was made even better with the addition of Morris, Colin and Emmaâ€™s dog.
- Frosty weather this week is quite novel on the morning walks.
- Maudeâ€™s some how sliced her paw and now has to wear a silly little boot which she hates.
- Decemberâ€™s gonna get busy so had a very slow weekend taking it easy. Ended up watching a lot of the UK Championship (snooker) which then led to us watching a documentary film about Ronnie Oâ€™Sullivan, I thought it might be more mad based off his wikipedia page but it was still good.
- Put the final touches on the bike box too, put a nice latch on the people gate and our house number on the front of the box. There wasnâ€™t a lot of good (typographically speaking choices) but we found someone doing metal numbers in Neutraface on Etsy. Looks tidy.

- Spotify Wrapped this week, The National were my number one again ðŸ™ˆ, it does annoy me they bring it out a whole month before the year is up!? Do they count last years December, or is it 11 months worth of stats. Totally opaque... This is why [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/jonheslop) is better.
