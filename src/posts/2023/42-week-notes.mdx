- Slow week, I had a cold and felt groggy for the first few days.
- We bought a nail gun so we could clad the bike box quicker. It’s very satisfying to use and slightly terrifying the first few goes.
- We made some good progress with the bike box on the weekend, Bec got a good system going with a roofing torch to char the larch. And I got into the rhythm with cutting them to size and fixing them on, it’s not going to take quite as long as we thought.
- Next up we need to hang the doors and fit locks which I think is going to be tricky. Have spent £50 on stainless steel parliament hinges which hopefully should do the job.
- We had friends over for pizza on Sunday, was the first (and probably only) time we’ve used the pizza oven this year. It’s fun and it is tasty, we should do it more next year.
- When I started doing these weeknotes, I failed to consider my urls properly the fact they would repeat yearly, so this one has a gross url, I need to make it so I can nest the files like <code>2023/42-week-notes</code> or something so they look nicer.
