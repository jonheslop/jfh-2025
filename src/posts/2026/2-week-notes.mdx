Chilly weather, classic January. It’s good to know the days are getting longer but it doesn’t really feel like it yet.

Five years ago, when we moved into this house, after 9 months of renovation we’d kinda burnt out on DIY. But last weekend we made a start on getting the decorating finished. Until know basically everywhere was just white. We’ve painted the hall and spare bedroom... an off white (Little Greene’s slacked lime - mid). I should know this using whites/off-white all the time in web design... but I was worried it was a little tame and you’d barely notice but it looks great! All the whites now really pop — ceiling, coving, picture rails and light switches. I’m really chuffed with it. We’ve ordered some more out there colours for the living room and bedroom. So more updates soon.

I went to the office Thursday, nice to get into the city, Maude and I get off the tube three stops early and walk through Hyde Park which is a nice way to start the day.

On Friday, I met [Björn Rust](https://bjornrust.com/) at [William the Fourth](https://www.william-the-fourth.com/), we’d never met IRL but have been aware of each other online for like 15 years!!! It was really nice to chat and I was blown away by Björn’s [portable computer](https://imagedelivery.net/tfgleCjJafHVtd2F4ngDnQ/IMG_0323/large) which is modular and runs linux on a Raspberry Pi. Bec, Franko and Andrea joined after a while and it was nice to spend the evening with everyone.

With all the morning frosts at the moment I’m not interested in riding outside, so a month ago and bought a Wahoo Kickr of eBay and I’ve been Zwifting a few times a week. It feels really productive and it’s good how time efficient it is. Until today I’d just been doing workouts where it tells you how many watts to do for how long. Today I did a hill climb thing on [Col de Peyresourde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Col_de_Peyresourde) which I did IRL about 10 years ago. It was tough but satisfying.

After adding the [photo stream](/stream) [last week](/posts/2026/photo-stream), this week I’ve added a [links section](/links) where I can post any stand out things I’ve read. I’m writing directly to my [Turso DB](https://turso.tech/) but I think I’ll make my own bookmarklet or something to make it eaiser.

I’m enjoying _[The Traitors](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/p0db9b2t/the-traitors?seriesId=p0db9b2t-structural-4-m002nzpr)_, they’ve really ramped up the drama this time. I’ve never really rooted for the traitors before but this time it would be quite impressive if they last all the way.

We also watched _[Banjo and Ro’s Grand Island Hotel](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m002pmzj/banjo-and-ros-grand-island-hotel-series-1-1-home)_ I’d never heard of them before but my sister’s friend paints the hall mural on episode two, so heard via fam. We were hooked as DIY fans, it’s fun to watch them take on something so challenging and obviously the scenery is beautiful. Banjo and Ro are a fun duo, it’s impressive what they pull off. The programmes production is heavily riffing on Wes Anderson vibes (the framing, music, and title treatments) but I’m ok with that.
