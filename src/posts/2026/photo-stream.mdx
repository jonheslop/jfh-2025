description: New year, new photo stream section

I really love [retro.app](https://retro.app/u/jonheslop), I tried to copy the weekly layout of images on my website a while back but I over engineered it with a SQLite DB and then that broke and I never revived it.

Then today on Bluesky I saw [this post](https://bsky.app/profile/iamrob.in/post/3mbenunofu22b) by [Robin Spielmann](https://www.iamrob.in/) about his [365 project](https://robins.photos/365) and I thought I could throw something together for 2026. I post pretty much daily on Retro any way, I have CLI things to get photos on cloudflare quickly and I have this newish Astro site which I’ve been tinkering with lately.

I’d like to make it easier to do from my phone with no manual commits but in the mean time [this will do](https://github.com/jonheslop/jfh-2025/pull/7).

So the [first photo is up](/stream/2026/1/) of Maude, we’ve both spent most of the first day of the year horizontal on this sofa taking it very easy.

Happy New Year!
